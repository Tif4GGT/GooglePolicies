policy_name:  Ensure 2-Step Verification (Multi-Factor Authentication) is enforced for all users in administrative roles
description: | Enforce 2-Step Verification (Multi-Factor Authentication) for all users assigned administrative roles. These include roles such as: Help Desk Admin, Groups Admin, Super Admin, Services Admin, User Management Admin ,Mobile Admin ,Android Admin and Custom Admin Roles.
rationale: | Add an extra layer of security to users accounts by asking users to verify their identity when they enter a username and password. 2-Step Verification (Multi-factor authentication) requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. 2-Step Verification provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With 2-Step Verification, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.
