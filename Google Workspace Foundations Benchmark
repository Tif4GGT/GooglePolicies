policy_name:  Ensure 2-Step Verification (Multi-Factor Authentication) is enforced for all users in administrative roles
description:  Enforce 2-Step Verification (Multi-Factor Authentication) for all users assigned administrative roles.
rationale: |
Add an extra layer of security to users accounts by asking users to verify their identity when they enter a username and password. 2-Step Verification (Multi-factor authentication) requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. 2-Step Verification provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With 2-Step Verification, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.
audit: |
To verify the 2-Step Verification (multi-factor authentication) configuration for administrators, use the Google Workspace Admin Console:
1. Log in to https://admin.google.com as an administrator
2. Go to Security and click on 2-Step Verification
3. Select the appropriate group with ALL ADMIN ROLES -- Create this group if needed
4. Under Authentication, ensure Allow users to turn on 2-Step Verification is checked
5. Ensure Enforcement is set to On
6. Ensure New user enrollment period is set to 2 weeks
7. Under Frequency, ensure Allow user to trust device is not checked

policy_name: Ensure Advanced Protection Program is configured
description: Enable Google's Advanced Protection Platform for all users and prevent the use of security codes where applicable.
rationale: |
Sophisticated phishing tactics can trick the most savvy users into giving their sign-in credentials to attackers. Advanced Protection requires you to use a security key, which is a hardware device or special software on your phone used to verify your identity, to sign in to your Google Account. Unauthorized users won’t be able to sign in without your security key, even if they have your username and password. The Advanced Protection Program includes a curated group of high-security policies that are applied to enrolled accounts. Additional policies may be added to the Advanced Protection Program to ensure the protections are current. Advanced Protection allows you to apply all of these protections at once, and override similar settings you may have configured manually.
audit: |
To verify Google's Advanced Protection Program is configured, use the Google Workspace Admin Console:
1. Log in to https://admin.google.com as an administrator
2. Select Security

policy_name: Ensure Google session control is configured
description: Configure Google Workspace's session control to strengthen session expiration.
rationale: |
As an administrator, you can control how long users can access Google services, such as Gmail on the web, without having to sign in again. For example, for users that work remotely or from untrusted locations, you might want to limit the time that they can access sensitive resources by applying a shorter web session length. If users want to continue accessing a resource when a session ends, they’re prompted to sign in again and start a new session. How the settings work on mobile devices varies by device and app.
audit: |
To verify Google session control is configured, use the Google Workspace Admin Console:
1. Log in to https://admin.google.com as an administrator
2. Select Security
3. Select Google session control

policy_name: Ensure less secure app access is disabled
description: Configure Google Workspace security settings to prevent access to less secure apps.
rationale: |
You can block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that are less secure. Apps that are less secure don't use modern security standards, such as OAuth. Using apps and devices that don’t use modern security standards increases the risk of accounts being compromised. Blocking these apps and devices helps keep your users and data safe.
audit: |
To verify less secure app access is disabled, use the Google Workspace Admin Console:
1. Log in to https://admin.google.com as an administrator
2. Select Security

policy_name: Ensure directory data access is externally restricted
description: Configure Google Workspace's external directory sharing to prevent unrestricted directory data access.
rationale: |
If your organization uses third-party apps that integrate with your Google services, you control how much Directory information the external apps can access. If you allow directory access, your users have a better experience with external apps. For example, when they use a third-party mail app, they want to find domain contacts and have email addresses automatically complete. The app needs access to Directory data to make this happen. However, this has the ability to share ALL domain AND public data with the connected third-party app.
audit: |
To verify directory data access is externally restricted, use the Google Workspace Admin Console:
1. Log in to https://admin.google.com as an administrator
2. Open the collapsed menu via "hamburger button \ 3 horizontal lines"
3. Under Directory, select Directory settings
4. Under Sharing settings, select External Directory sharing
